                    <br> Newton was an
                    English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the
                    most influential
                    men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered
                    to be the most
                    influential book in the history of science.

                    his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2.
                    Einstein received
                    the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his
                    discovery of the law of
                    the photoelectric effect.
